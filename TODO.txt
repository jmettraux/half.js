[o] allow for post without params (args.pop instead of args.shift)
[o] Half.go('/api') (absolute URI is an exception...)
[x] provide a default, logging onError
    (what about IE? Well, if no console, then no logging... (and no error))
[o] in case of form validation issue, use onError (do not raise immediately...)

[ ] ?_method=DELETE ?
    that'd mean DELETE turned into a POST with that uri suffix ?

[ ] implement the curie thinggy
